        <h3>My story....</h3>
        <p><img src="img/me.jpg" id="img2" class="img-responsive" alt="a photo of my dog Bella"><br>After graduating from the University of Oregon with a Bachelor's degree in French (oui, je parle francais!), I found myself working various administrative positions, and through the years I often felt something was missing. After some reflection I decided to make a change. I began my journey by starting a photography business (see my photography portfolio <a href="http://www.katyannphotography.com/" target="_blank">here</a>).<br><br>I soon got my first clients and had a small portfolio. Not long after I wanted to build a website for my growing business. I didn't want a cookie cutter site and I wanted to really build it from the bottom up. I soon found online courses and started learning HTML and CSS in my spare time.
        <br><br>It wasn't long before found myself spending a lot of time coding and I discovered that I had an appeitite to learn more. I did some research and decided to go back to school. <br><br>I have finished my courses at a local code school in Portland Oregon, my emphasis is on JavaScript, PHP and Drupal. I am looking forward to applying my new skills to the workplace. If you are interested in my professional history please see my LinkedIn profile <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katyhenning"target="_blank"> here</a>.<br><br> Sincerely,<br><br> Katy </p>
